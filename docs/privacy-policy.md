# Privacy Policy

VocabForager does not export any data outside of the user's machine without the user requesting it. All the data it collects is stored within the browser and is implied by the extension's functionality. This only includes:

- **Web History**: VocabForager stores the URLs and titles of webpages to persist highlight marks on said webpages across site visits and to help users navigate to previously marked sites.
- **Website Content**: VocabForager stores text from websites that a user has highlighted to support several functionalities: rehighlighting text, "quiz" making, options.

All data is persisted in the browser using technologies such as [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) and [IndexedDB](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/storage/indexeddb/). The only time this data is exported is when the user requests to "Export Extension Data", which wraps this data (including the data above), into a JSON file and places it in whatever directory the Chrome browser is configured to store downloaded content into. For the vast (vast, vast) majority of cases, this would be a "Downloads" directory on the computer the user is on.
